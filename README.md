This project will be different than any other i've done, this repo will be full of ideas, sketches, and just random things i think while trying to make a minisat for attitude determination.
This is the practical part of my thesis work, i think it's easier to understand something if you can see it in action.
This practical part of the project was more or less just an impulse, it's not critical (didn't even tell my teacher about it), so if it works, good, if not, at least i'll learn something.
